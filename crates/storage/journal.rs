//! # State-history journal
//!
//! Per-block reverse-diff entries persisted to disk so reorgs deeper than the
//! in-memory `TrieLayerCache` become possible up to the finalized boundary.
//!
//! Each entry captures the previous on-disk values (or absence markers) for every
//! account-trie node, storage-trie node, account flat-key-value, and storage
//! flat-key-value path that a single layer commit overwrites. Codes are
//! content-addressed and not journaled.
//!
//! Entries are keyed by `block_number.to_be_bytes()` in the
//! [`STATE_HISTORY`](crate::api::tables::STATE_HISTORY) column family. Big-endian
//! ensures lexicographic order matches numeric order, which lets finality
//! pruning use a single `delete_range`.
//!
//! ## Pruning model
//!
//! When a `forkchoice_update` advances the finalized block past a multiple of
//! [`JOURNAL_PRUNE_INTERVAL`], `forkchoice_update_inner` calls
//! `delete_range(STATE_HISTORY, 0, finalized_number + 1)`, removing all journal
//! entries at or below the new finality boundary. The surviving entries cover
//! `[finalized_number+1, cache_edge_D]` plus up to `JOURNAL_PRUNE_INTERVAL`
//! already-finalized entries not yet swept, which is a superset of the window a
//! future deep reorg could need. After pruning,
//! `Store::lowest_state_history_block_number` reflects the new floor.
//!
//! Pruning is batched rather than run on every advance because each call writes a
//! RocksDB range tombstone anchored at key 0, so consecutive calls overlap
//! completely. RocksDB re-fragments and re-sorts the whole overlapping set on
//! every read that crosses it, making read cost grow with the number of
//! tombstones. On an L2 follower — which finalizes every block it imports, see
//! `L2BlockImporter::import_ready_blocks` — that is one tombstone per block, and
//! import throughput decayed from ~80 blocks/s to under 4 over a few thousand
//! blocks, recovering on every restart. A 30-second profile of a follower in that
//! state put 86% of process CPU in `FragmentedRangeTombstoneList::FragmentTombstones`
//! and the sorts beneath it.
//!
//! ## Batch mode (full sync)
//!
//! When `batch_mode == true` (full sync), the commit path skips journaling
//! entirely. A full-sync import writes one layer per ~1024 blocks and does
//! not produce the per-block reverse-diffs needed for deep reorgs. Reorg
//! support is only active after the node transitions to normal block-by-block
//! execution.
//!
//! ## Codec
//!
//! Entries use a hand-rolled compact format: a version byte at offset 0, then
//! `block_hash` (32 bytes), `parent_state_root` (32 bytes), then four
//! varint-prefixed reverse-diff sections in order: account-trie, storage-trie,
//! account flat-KV, storage flat-KV. RLP/bincode/postcard are skipped — the
//! access pattern (write-once, read-on-reorg, large volume) makes encode/decode
//! cost matter.
//!
//! ## Version strategy
//!
//! [`JOURNAL_VERSION`] is a single byte at offset 0 of every entry. The decoder
//! rejects any version other than the current one with
//! [`JournalDecodeError::VersionMismatch`]. On a codec bump, the journal should
//! be drained at a finality boundary so the new binary starts with an empty
//! journal and never encounters old-format entries. A future bump that needs to
//! keep history across the upgrade should introduce per-version `decode_vN` arms
//! rather than re-encoding existing entries.
